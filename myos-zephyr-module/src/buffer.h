 * @brief Generic Buffer Implementation
 *
 * @details This file contains an abstract and generic implementation of a buffer
 *          using preprocessor macros. The implementation is designed to be flexible
 *          and adaptable to various data types and buffer sizes. It includes macros
 *          for defining buffer types, initializing buffers, and performing common
 *          buffer operations such as adding items, checking fullness or emptiness,
 *          and accessing buffer elements.
 *
 * Buffers in General:
 *          A buffer is a contiguous block of memory used to store a collection of
 *          objects of a certain data type. Buffers are commonly used in various
 *          programming scenarios, such as IO operations, communication systems,
 *          data processing, and temporary storage of data. They are essential in
 *          scenarios where there is a difference in the rate at which data is
 *          received and processed, serving as a temporary holding place for the
 *          data during these operations.
 *
 *          Buffers can be implemented in various ways depending on the requirements,
 *          such as circular buffers for streaming data, FIFO (First-In-First-Out) for
 *          queue implementations, or simple static arrays for fixed-size storage.
 *
 *          This implementation provides a generic way to define and manipulate buffers
 *          using macros, making it adaptable to a wide range of use cases. It allows
 *          users to define buffers for different data types and sizes and includes
 *          necessary operations for managing buffer data effectively.
 *
 * Usage:
 *          To use this implementation, include this header file in your project, and
 *          utilize the provided macros to define and work with buffers. Ensure to check
 *          buffer constraints like fullness or emptiness before performing relevant
 *          operations.

/**
 * @brief Declares a new buffer type.
 *
 * @details This macro is used to declare a new buffer type with a specified name, item type, and size.
 *          It creates a typedef for a struct, which includes a count of the current number of items in the
 *          buffer and an array of items of the specified type. The size of the array is set based on the
 *          provided size parameter. The defined type can be used in combination with `BUFFER_T` to declare
 *          buffer variables of this type, potentially with different storage class specifiers.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(intBuffer, int, 10);       // Creates a buffer type for integers with a capacity of 10
 * static BUFFER_T(intBuffer) myBuffer;      // Declares a static buffer variable of the newly created type
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param name The unique identification name for the buffer type. This name is used with `BUFFER_T` to define buffer variables.
 * @param type The data type of the items that the buffer will hold.
 * @param size The number of items of \a type that the buffer can hold.

 *          The macro expands to the type name of the buffer, allowing for the declaration of buffer
 *          variables. It can be combined with different storage class specifiers (like static, extern, volatile)
 *          for additional behavior control of the buffer variable.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(intBuffer, int, 10);  // First, create a buffer type for integers
 * static BUFFER_T(intBuffer) myBuffer; // Then, define a static buffer variable of that type
 * @endcode

/**
 * @brief Retrieves a pointer to the items array within a buffer.
 *
 * @details This macro provides access to the items contained in a buffer by returning
 *          a pointer to the first element of the buffer's internal array. The type of
 *          the returned pointer matches the type of the items in the buffer, as defined
 *          by the `BUFFER_TYPEDEF` macro. This allows for direct access and manipulation
 *          of the buffer's items.
 *
 *          It is useful for operations that require iterating over the buffer items or
 *          accessing them by index. Since the pointer is of the buffer's item type, it
 *          ensures type safety and consistency in buffer operations.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(intBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(intBuffer) myBuffer;
 * int* items = BUFFER_ITEMS(myBuffer);
 * items[0] = 5; // Directly access and modify the first item in the buffer
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer variable from which to retrieve the items pointer.
 * @return A pointer of the buffer's item type, pointing to the buffer's internal items array.
 */
#define BUFFER_ITEMS(buffer) \
    ((buffer).items)

/**
 * @brief Returns a raw (untyped) pointer to the buffer items.
 * @details This macro provides access to the internal items of the buffer as
 *          a raw memory pointer. It casts the pointer to the buffer's items to
 *          a `uint8_t*` (pointer to unsigned 8-bit integers), enabling operations
 *          on the buffer's contents at the byte level. This can be useful for
 *          operations such as serialization, memory manipulation, or when interacting
 *          with APIs that require byte-level data access.
 *
 *          The returned pointer points to the start of the buffer's internal array,
 *          allowing direct access to its raw bytes. This should be used with caution,
 *          as it bypasses type safety provided by the buffer's defined item type.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * BUFFER_INIT(buffer);
 * uint8_t* rawItems = BUFFER_RAW(buffer);
 * // rawItems now points to the buffer's internal memory as a byte array
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance from which to retrieve the raw items pointer.
 * @return A `uint8_t*` pointer to the buffer's internal items array.
 */
#define BUFFER_RAW(buffer) \
	((uint8_t*)BUFFER_ITEMS(buffer))

/**
 * @brief Returns the size of the buffer in bytes.
 * @details This macro calculates the total size of the buffer's items in bytes.
 *          It does this by taking the size of the buffer's internal array, which
 *          is determined using the `sizeof` operator. The result reflects the
 *          total memory footprint of the buffer's content, excluding any additional
 *          metadata like the item count. This size information can be particularly
 *          useful for operations like memory allocation, copying, or serialization
 *          where the byte-size of the buffer content is required.
 *
 *          It is important to note that this macro provides the size of the items
 *          array within the buffer, not the number of items currently stored in it.
 *          The size in bytes is constant, based on the buffer's declared capacity.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * size_t bufferSizeBytes = BUFFER_SIZEOF(buffer);
 * // bufferSizeBytes is now equal to the total byte size of 10 integers
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance for which to determine the size in bytes.
 * @return The size of the buffer's items array in bytes.
 */
#define BUFFER_SIZEOF(buffer) \
    (sizeof(BUFFER_ITEMS(buffer)))


/**
 * @brief Returns the maximum capacity of the buffer in terms of number of items.
 * @details This macro calculates the maximum number of items that the buffer can hold.
 *          It divides the total size of the buffer's items array in bytes (obtained using
 *          `BUFFER_SIZEOF(buffer)`) by the size of a single item in the array. This
 *          calculation gives the total capacity of the buffer, indicating how many items
 *          of the specified type the buffer can store.
 *
 *          This macro is useful for understanding the limits of the buffer and ensuring
 *          that operations such as adding items do not exceed its capacity. It is
 *          particularly important in buffer management logic, where the buffer's capacity
 *          constraints must be respected to avoid overflows.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * size_t bufferCapacity = BUFFER_SIZE(buffer);
 * // bufferCapacity now holds the value 10, the maximum number of integers the buffer can store
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance for which to determine the maximum capacity.
 * @return The maximum number of items that the buffer can hold.
 */
#define BUFFER_SIZE(buffer) \
    (BUFFER_SIZEOF(buffer)/sizeof(BUFFER_ITEMS(buffer)[0]))

/**
 * @brief Returns the current number of items in the buffer.
 * @details This macro retrieves the current count of items stored in the buffer.
 *          The count is maintained as part of the buffer's structure and is updated
 *          whenever items are added to or removed from the buffer. This macro
 *          provides a direct way to access this count, allowing for checks on how
 *          many items are currently stored in the buffer.
 *
 *          The count value is essential for operations such as adding new items
 *          (to prevent buffer overflow) or iterating over the items in the buffer.
 *          It provides a real-time count of how much of the buffer's capacity is being utilized.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * BUFFER_INIT(buffer);
 * // After adding items to the buffer...
 * size_t itemCount = BUFFER_COUNT(buffer);
 * // itemCount now holds the number of items currently in the buffer
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance for which to determine the current item count.
 * @return The number of items currently stored in the buffer.
 */
#define BUFFER_COUNT(buffer) \
    ((buffer).count)

/**
 * @brief Initializes the buffer.
 * @details This macro initializes the specified buffer by setting its item count to zero.
 *          This operation effectively resets the buffer, marking it as empty and ready
 *          for use. It's a crucial step in buffer management, ensuring that the buffer
 *          starts in a known state before any items are added or removed.
 *
 *          Initialization should be performed immediately after declaring a buffer variable
 *          to avoid operating on uninitialized or potentially corrupted data. This macro
 *          simplifies the initialization process by encapsulating the necessary steps into
 *          a single, easy-to-use command.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * BUFFER_INIT(buffer);
 * // The buffer 'buffer' is now initialized and ready for use
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance to be initialized.
 */
#define BUFFER_INIT(buffer) \
    do{BUFFER_COUNT(buffer)=0;}while(0)


/**
 * @brief Checks if the buffer is full.
 * @details This macro evaluates whether the buffer has reached its maximum capacity.
 *          It compares the current number of items in the buffer (obtained via
 *          `BUFFER_COUNT(buffer)`) with the buffer's maximum size (obtained via
 *          `BUFFER_SIZE(buffer)`). If the count of items is greater than or equal to
 *          the buffer's capacity, the macro returns 1, indicating that the buffer is full
 *          and cannot accommodate any more items. Otherwise, it returns 0.
 *
 *          This check is essential to prevent buffer overflows, especially before
 *          performing operations that add items to the buffer. Using this macro
 *          ensures that any such additions are made safely and within the buffer's capacity limits.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * BUFFER_INIT(buffer);
 * // After adding some items to the buffer...
 * if (BUFFER_FULL(buffer)) {
 *     // Buffer is full, take appropriate actions
 * } else {
 *     // Buffer still has space for more items
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance to be checked for fullness.
 * @return 1 if the buffer is full, 0 otherwise.
 */
#define BUFFER_FULL(buffer) \
    (BUFFER_COUNT(buffer)>=BUFFER_SIZE(buffer))

/**
 * @brief Checks if the buffer is empty.
 * @details This macro determines whether the buffer currently contains no items.
 *          It evaluates the current item count in the buffer (using `BUFFER_COUNT(buffer)`)
 *          and returns 1 (true) if the count is zero, indicating that the buffer is empty.
 *          If the buffer contains one or more items, it returns 0 (false).
 *
 *          This check is useful for operations that require knowledge of whether the buffer
 *          has any data in it, such as avoiding underflows when attempting to remove or
 *          process items from the buffer. Using this macro ensures safe and efficient buffer
 *          management by providing a clear and concise check for the buffer's emptiness.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * BUFFER_INIT(buffer);
 * // After some operations on the buffer...
 * if (BUFFER_EMPTY(buffer)) {
 *     // Buffer is empty, no items to process
 * } else {
 *     // Buffer contains items that can be processed
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance to check for emptiness.
 * @return 1 if the buffer is empty, 0 otherwise.
 */
#define BUFFER_EMPTY(buffer) \

/**
 * @brief Advances the buffer to the next free item.
 * @details This macro increments the count of items in the buffer, effectively
 *          moving the buffer's position to the next free item. It is used after
 *          adding an item to the buffer to update the buffer's count accordingly.
 *
 *          It is important to note that this macro does not perform any check for
 *          buffer overflow. Therefore, its use without prior verification can lead
 *          to undefined behavior if the buffer is already full. It is recommended
 *          to always use `BUFFER_FULL` to check the buffer's capacity before
 *          adding new items and using this macro.
 *
 *          The macro simplifies the process of managing the buffer's count and
 *          ensures the buffer state is correctly updated after each insertion.
 *          However, caution must be exercised to avoid overflows.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * BUFFER_INIT(buffer);
 * if (!BUFFER_FULL(buffer)) {
 *     // Add item to buffer
 *     BUFFER_VAL(buffer) = newItem;
 *     BUFFER_NEXT(buffer); // Move to next free item
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance to be advanced to the next item.
 */
#define BUFFER_NEXT(buffer) \
    (++BUFFER_COUNT(buffer))

/**
 * @brief Retrieves the current free item in the buffer.
 * @details This macro provides access to the next free (or current end) item in the
 *          buffer by returning its value. It does this by accessing the item in the
 *          buffer's internal array at the position indicated by the current item count.
 *          This macro is typically used to directly read or write the value of the next
 *          free item in the buffer.
 *
 *          It is important to ensure that the buffer is not full before using this macro
 *          to add new items. Writing to the buffer using this macro when it is full can
 *          lead to buffer overflow and undefined behavior. Always use `BUFFER_FULL`
 *          to check if there is space available in the buffer before using `BUFFER_VAL`.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * BUFFER_INIT(buffer);
 * if (!BUFFER_FULL(buffer)) {
 *     BUFFER_VAL(buffer) = newValue; // Set the value of the next free item
 *     BUFFER_NEXT(buffer);           // Advance the buffer to the next position
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance from which to retrieve the current free item.
 * @return The value of the current free item in the buffer.
 */
#define BUFFER_VAL(buffer) \
    (BUFFER_ITEMS(buffer)[BUFFER_COUNT(buffer)])

/**
 * @brief Retrieves a pointer to the current free item in the buffer.
 * @details This macro provides a pointer to the next free (or current end) item in
 *          the buffer. It achieves this by obtaining the address of the item at the
 *          current buffer count position. This pointer can be used for direct manipulation
 *          or assignment of the buffer's next free item.
 *
 *          Similar to `BUFFER_VAL`, it's crucial to ensure that the buffer is not full
 *          before using this macro for adding new items. Writing to the buffer using
 *          this macro when the buffer is full can lead to buffer overflow and undefined
 *          behavior. Therefore, always check the buffer's capacity using `BUFFER_FULL`
 *          before using `BUFFER_PTR` to access or modify the buffer's contents.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * BUFFER_INIT(buffer);
 * if (!BUFFER_FULL(buffer)) {
 *     *BUFFER_PTR(buffer) = newValue; // Directly set the value of the next free item
 *     BUFFER_NEXT(buffer);            // Advance the buffer to the next position
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @param buffer The buffer instance from which to retrieve the pointer to the current free item.
 * @return A pointer to the current free item in the buffer.

/**
 * @brief Appends an item to the buffer.
 * @details This macro is used to append an item to the buffer by directly setting
 *          the value of the next free item and then incrementing the buffer's count.
 *          It simplifies the process of adding an item to the buffer, combining the
 *          assignment of the item's value and advancing the buffer count into a single step.
 *
 *          However, this macro does not perform a buffer overflow check. Therefore,
 *          it is important to use `BUFFER_FULL` to verify that there is space available
 *          in the buffer before using `BUFFER_APPEND`. Appending an item to a full buffer
 *          results in undefined behavior and could potentially lead to buffer overflows.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * @code
 * BUFFER_TYPEDEF(myBuffer, int, 10);
 * BUFFER_T(myBuffer) buffer;
 * BUFFER_INIT(buffer);
 * if (!BUFFER_FULL(buffer)) {
 *     BUFFER_APPEND(buffer, newValue); // Append newValue to the buffer
